    <p>
        Established in January 2023. Altforge Studios was created in the dreams of developing games using Unreal Engine 5. <br />
        From creating game ready assets, sculpting models, to coding mobs and functions. Altforge studios was put forth with <br />
        a big vision. To give the public a nostalgic game where they can sit back after a tiring day and play with their family and friends.
    </p>

    <p>
        In August 2023. The team of Altforge Studios has temporarily stopped their development in order to purse each of their careers. <br />
        Each focusing on their specific courses which they can further better their individual portfolios and skills.<br />
